        <p>
          We propose an approach to solve the image matching problem with some stochastic 
          optimization approach, in which the search for the optimal solution involves randomness in some constructive way.
          If $\mathcal{S}$ denotes the (finite) set of all possible solutions, the task we consider is to maximize or minimize the objective function $f : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
          In the case of maximization, on which we focus here, the problem is to find a configuration $x_{o p t} \in \mathcal{S}$ which satisfies
          $$
          f\left(x_{o p t}\right) \geq f(x) \text { for all } x \in \mathcal{S}.
          $$

        <p>
          Genetic algorithms operate on a set of individuals (solutions) which form a population for a determined generation, then either two individuals are selected and combined in a crossover operation or each individual is mutated.
        </p>
        <p>
          We might refer to an approximate solution as a <em>"candidate"</em>, or the solution's <em>"DNA"</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          A genetic algorithm tries to solve the image matching problem by starting with a random population of 260 sets of DNA consisting in form of genes with a length of 5. A fitness function is used to identify the best and worst DNA. To get a measure of how similar two images are, we calculate the root-mean-square error (RMSE) value of the difference between the images. If the images are exactly identical, this value is zero.
          RMSE is defined as
          $$
          \mathrm{RMSE}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(y_{j}-\hat{y}_{j}\right)^{2}}.
          $$
        </p>
        <p>
          Crossover and mutations are randomly performed in order to generate new solutions. Then, based on a selection criterion, the strongest individuals (those with the best value of a performance metric) survive and remain for the next generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process is repeated until some stopping conditions are fulfilled. In order to perform the selection of the individuals in the GA a fitness value needs to be defined. This fitness value measures the quality of the individuals and enables them to be compared.
